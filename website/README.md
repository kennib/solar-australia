# Solar Powering Australia

## [`wlan-0a1180d4.ipt.nicta.com.au:3000`](wlan-0a1180d4.ipt.nicta.com.au:3000)

## The aim
Your aim is to power the 15 largest cities in Australia completely with Solar Energy.
The team that can power Australia while making the most money will be victorious!

Place solar farms in such a way that you can minimize costs and maximize revenues.
The best areas to place solar farms will be those that are given the most energy from the Sun
and are the closest to the cities that need the most power.

## The details
### Input data
The input data gives us the GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) for the entire area of Australia.

We've prepared the data as [GeoJSON file](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html).
The dataset consists of 839 by 679 points at the centre of areas 5km high and 5km wide.
For each point there is an `avgGHI` property.
The average GHI indicates how many MegaJoules per square metre that area receives per day from the Sun.

You can [download the data as GeoJSON here](/data/ghis.geojson.zip).

For the list of cities there is also a [GeoJSON file](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html).
To make things simple each city is a singular point with a name and population.
Each city needs an amount of energy proportional to its population.

You can [download the cities as GeoJSON here](/data/cities.geojson).

### Output data
Your output should be a subset of the points given in the GHI GeoJSON.
Each solar farm will provide power for the city to which it is closest.

You can [download an example of GeoJSON with three solar farms here](/data/solar-farms.geojson).

### Submission

You can submit your GeoJSON through a [web page](/submit) or via the command line.

#### Web
[Submit your GeoJSON](/submit) through the web browser.

#### Command line
You can submit your file from the command line via curl.
Here's an example of a submission of `solarfarms.geojson`:

```bash
$ curl wlan-0a1180d4.ipt.nicta.com.au:3000/submit --form "submission=@solarfarms.geojson" --form "team=winners"
Thanks team 'winners'! You are ranked 1. With a score of 1.337e8
```

### The equations
The amount of money that can be made from the solar farms is
```
profit = (min(energy-produced, energy-needed) * energy-price) - (solar-farm-cost * number-of-solar-farms)
where
energy-price = $0.12 per KWh
```
Note that you can only sell energy if it will be used.

---

The amount of energy needed is calculated per city as
```
energy-needed = (population-of-city * energy-per-capita-per-year) kWh per year
where
energy-per-capita-per-year = 10,712.18 kWh per year
```

---

The total amount of energy produced by a set of solar panels is
```
energy-produced = sum(solar-farm-energy for each solar-farm)
```
The energy from a farm will go to its closest city

---

Each solar farm is based off the [Topaz Solar Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz_Solar_Farm) (the largest solar farm in the world).
So each farm is 5km by 5km and costs $2.5 billion dollars.
```
solar-farm-cost = $2.5e9

solar-farm-energy = (ghi MJ/m^2/day) * (5000 m * 5000 m) * solar-farm-efficiency * (MJ/KWh) * (365 days) * (1 - transmission-loss)
where
(MJ/KWh) = 3.6
solar-farm-efficiency = 0.4
transmission-loss = (distance-to-city metres) * (1e-7 per metre)
```
Note that the ghi will vary per solar farm. It's your job to optimise this number.
To Calculate the distance between a city and a solar farm you can use the [Haversine formula](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).
